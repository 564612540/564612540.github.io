I am a PhD. student in Electrical Engineering at University of Minnesota. I recieved my B. E. in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China in 2018. Please see my [CV](https://564612540.github.io/cv) for more details.

My research interest is on the theoretical aspect of distributed optimization for machine learning. My recent work focuses on (1) understanding federated learning from different perspectives and resolve existing problems in federated learning including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency and differential privacy, (2) understanding distributed optimization algorithms and designing system specific algorithms, and (3) designing differentially private optimization algorithms with theoretical guarantees. For more details, please see my [publications](https://564612540.github.io/publications).
