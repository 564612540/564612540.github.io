I am a Postdoc in Industrial and System Engineering at the University of Southern California. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2023 and my M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering in 2022 at the University of Minnesota. I received my B.E. in Automation from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2018. Please see my [CV](https://564612540.github.io/cv) for more details.

My research interest is in the theoretical aspect of distributed optimization and differential privacy for machine learning. My recent work focuses on 
* (1) understanding federated learning from different perspectives and resolving existing problems in federated learning, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and differential privacy,
* (2) understanding distributed optimization algorithms, designing system-specific algorithms, and making connections to signal processing and control theory,
* (3) designing differentially private optimization algorithms with theoretical guarantees.
