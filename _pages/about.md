I am a PhD. student in Electrical Engineering at University of Minnesota. I recieved my B. E. in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China in 2018. Please see my [CV](https://academicpages.github.io/cv) for more details.

I work on distributed algorithms and machine learning. My recent work focuses on (1) understanding federated learning from different perspectives and resolve existing problems in federated learning, (2) understanding distributed optimization algorithms and designing system specific algorithms. For more details, please see my [publications](https://academicpages.github.io/publications).
